    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>Time is the first aspect of construction estimating. Based on known values, how many man hours do you expect this project to take? Once you have this figured out, add at leas 15%. This will cover yourself from unforseen circumstances which are known to be frequent in the construction industry.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>When estimating getting an accurate gauge of all potential material costs is imperative. One factor which is often overlooked is lead time for production, delivery costs / logistics cost, and annual rate increases from suppliers.</p>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <br>
    <p><b><center>Construction estimating is half mathematics and half art. There is a fine line between making a fair profit and remaining competitive. This is a skill that will be refined over time and the way in which you bid on projects for different GC's may vary</center></b></p>
